I had just started learning to create GUI's in python using TKinter. 
I always loved coding and working with GUI for a very long time so why not use the language I prefer most and create GUIs with it. 
In this project i had used many methods to make this a an interesting GUI. 
Although it is simple i feel the methods learned with this will allow me to take on bigger and more complex projets in the future.
I hope you feel the same about my project as i do.
